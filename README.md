tsc-tablestorage-wrapper
========================

Object to Entity mapper for Windows Azure (Think ORM for table storage)

### Features
 * Super simple access to Azure Table Storage. Use your existing POCO C# objects and map Table Storage entities to them.
 * Easily unit test your code that accesses Table Storage with an in-memory test double. No complicated mocks or stubs required!
 * Automatically batches large reads & writes to optimize common operations.
 * Handles quirks of your local Azure emulator for you. (Upserts work locally!)

### Basic Example

```csharp
public class Color
{
  public string HexColorCode
  {
    get;
    set;
  }
}

var storageAccount = new ConnectionStringCloudStorageAccount( "YourConnectionStringHere" );
var tableStorage = new AzureTableStorageProvider( storageAccount );
var color = tableStorage.Get<Color>( "MyColorsTable", "Red", "Crimson" );

```
